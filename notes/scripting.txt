BASH Scripting
==============

What is a bash script
====================
- is a file containing a series of commands you want to run in sequence
- Instead of typing commands one by one in the terminal you can put them in a script to save time and automate tasks


First Bash script
=================
- bash scripts have .sh extension
- eg. script.sh

Example 1
=========
#!/bin/bash

echo "hello world"

Shebang line
============
#!/bin/bash 
- tells system to use bash to execute the script


Comments
========
use #


variables
=========
variable_name = value

eg
    name = 'vincent'

    Accesing variables
    ==================
    use $
    eg
        name='vincent'
        echo "My name is $name"


USER INPUT
==========
- use read command

eg
    # Get user name and store it in a variable_name
    read user_name



CONDOTIONAL STATEMENTS
======================
if, elif and else
use fi to close the if statement block

    SYNTAX
    ======
    if [ condition ]; then
        # commands if condition is true

    elif [ another condition]; then
        # commands

    else
        # commands

    fi

- use [[]] to do comparisons in conditions
    if [[ a < b ]]


COMPARISON OPERATORS IN BASH
============================
-eq = equal to
-ne = not equal to
-gt = greator than
-lt = Less than
-ge = greator than or equal to
-le = Less than or equal to

LOOP
====
- loop lets you to repeat a set of commands as long as a certain condition is true

    FOR LOOP
    ========
    - for loop runs a block of commands for each item in a list

    Example
    -------
    for variable in list; do
        # Commands to execute
    done


    WHILE LOOP
    ==========
    - while loop keeps running as long a certain condition is true

    SYNTAX
    ======
    while [ condition ]; do
        # commands to execute
    done



FUNCTIONS
=========
- allows you to execute a block of commands together

    SYNTAX
    ======
    function_name() {
        # commands to execute
    }

    or

    function function_name {
        # commands to execute
    }


    Example
    =======
    #!/bin/bash

    # Defining the function
    greet() {
        echo "Hello world!"
    }

    # Calling the function
    greet


    PASSING ARGUMENTS
    =================
    - acess arguments using $1, $2, $3, etc

    Example
    =======
        #!/bin/bash

        #Define the function
        greet() {
            echo "Hello, $1"
        }

        # Calling the fucntion with an arguments
        greet "Vincent"
