BASH Scripting
==============

What is a bash script
====================
- is a file containing a series of commands you want to run in sequence
- Instead of typing commands one by one in the terminal you can put them in a script to save time and automate tasks


First Bash script
=================
- bash scripts have .sh extension
- eg. script.sh

Example 1
=========
#!/bin/bash

echo "hello world"

Shebang line
============
#!/bin/bash 
- tells system to use bash to execute the script


Comments
========
use #


variables
=========
variable_name = value

eg
    name = 'vincent'

    Accesing variables
    ==================
    use $
    eg
        name='vincent'
        echo "My name is $name"


USER INPUT
==========
- use read command

eg
    # Get user name and store it in a variable_name
    read user_name



CONDOTIONAL STATEMENTS
======================
if, elif and else
use fi to close the if statement block

    SYNTAX
    ======
    if [ condition ]; then
        # commands if condition is true

    elif [ another condition]; then
        # commands

    else
        # commands

    fi

- use [[]] to do comparisons in conditions
    if [[ a < b ]]
